Using the map ADT

A map is a data structure that provides a collection containing unique 
keys associated with a single value.

Operations:

- Create empty map
- Find key in map
- Find value of a given key, if key exists
- Insert a key with its associated value, if key does not already exist
- Remove a key and its associated value
- Implement map ADT in file called mapYourLastName.java, to map email addresses (key) to people's names (value). Both can be Strings.

Your driver class should add at least 3 people, search for 2 people by 
key (email addresses) and remove all keys when done.

Submit your java files only in .zip folder.

Note from discussion board:

Just like Queue, you made a constructor and methods, here you define a 
class Map, decide how you are storing key, value pairs (in trees and 
lists we used nodes, queues we used an array)

Then have a Map() constructor, a method returning a boolean called 
findKey, a method returning the value of a given key getValue(key) if 
the key exists, ...

Then you will make a MapTester file. I provided Queue, Stack, but you 
will write your own here.
