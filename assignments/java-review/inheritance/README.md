# Instructions

Create a superclass clothing with two variables size and color.

Create three subclasses: shirt, pants, socks.

For shirt on the size allow only S,M,L and XL. pants will have no size restrictions, socks also no restriction.

For socks, think about how you use a sock class, like for laundry folder (HINT)

Recall subclasses extend the superclass. Include constructors, getters, setters, and toString().

Write tester to show all three subclasses in action!
