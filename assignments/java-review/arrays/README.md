# Instructions

Write a small program with a main only. Include comments and javadoc (It's never too soon to start a good habit or two!)

Include an array of size 10 (use a constant to set the size of your array) and fill it with random numbers between 1 and 25.

Write an enhanced loop to print to the array with the following format (note your first number will not necessarily be 13.0):

ArrayName element at index[0] = 13.0
