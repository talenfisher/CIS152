# Project Proposal
Implement a mailing list manager to help keep track of people subscribed to a mailing list.  This helps to automate the process of sending out emails to multiple people and keep track of statistics (who opened the email, who clicked on a link in the email, etc.).  Such a program would use a map for associating an email address with details about the owner of that email address.  It would also use a queue for sending out emails.
